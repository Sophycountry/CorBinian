Contains code to do parameter estimation for RBMs using Minimum Probability Flow learning, pseudolikelihood and Contrastive Divergence

Also contains code comparing the log likelihood of training data under RBMs trained via Minimum Probability Flow learning, pseudolikelihood, CD-1, and CD-10, for small RBMs.

See runme_compare.m for an example of how to use the code.
