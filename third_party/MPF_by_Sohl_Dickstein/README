This repository contains Matlab code implementing Minimum Probability
Flow learning for several cases, specifically:

    MPF_ising/ - parameter estimation in the Ising model
    MPF_RBM_compare_log_likelihood/ - parameter estimation in
        Restricted Boltzmann Machines. This directory also includes
        code comparing the log likelihood of small RBMs trained via
        pseudolikelihood and Contrastive Divergence to ones trained
        via MPF..
